# Product Maintenance Plan

Updated September 5, 2026. The mobile migration and the bounded M1-M3/startup maintenance work
are implemented, including the code-hygiene corrective pass. Publication status belongs to the
exact-revision hosted workflow and public verification, not a moving status copied into this plan.

Historical implementation detail belongs in `ITERATION_LOG.md`, release criteria in
`docs/release-quality-gates.md`, candidate evidence in `docs/physical-release-evidence.md`, and
release scope in `docs/releases/v0.1.6.md`. Do not duplicate completed phases here.

## Publication Contract

1. Require frozen-candidate verification for Today history states, real catalog module ownership,
   Affect input cleanup and removal of the unused session-only export.
2. Commit/push; await successful exact-revision CI, Pages and public smoke.
3. Repeat affected EN/RO x theme browser journeys on the public URL with isolated synthetic data.

The implementation distinguishes pending/error/empty history without blocking Quick, rejects
eager full-catalog modules during build, and retains canonical labels and deterministic safety.
The active plan is shortened; the generated Playwright run marker is no longer tracked.
No further feature phase is mandatory once this candidate passes publication gates.

## Conditional Next Work

- **Vocabulary:** only a deliberately selected incomplete reachable choice group, with EN/RO
  editorial review and provenance. Current coverage is 66 reviewed meanings. Do not fill the
  catalog automatically or infer needs from new definitions; reviewed-null guidance stays intact.
- **Chunk recovery:** WebKit retained failed module state across reload in bounded simulations;
  reopening passed. Recent-summary copy names reopening. Investigate broader route retry only
  against a reproduced failure; no universal retry framework or automatic cache clearing.
- **Dependency/browser maintenance:** act on a current advisory or reproduced regression; no
  speculative major upgrades. M1's zero-audit result is historical, not a perpetual security claim.
- **Content questions:** masculine Romanian labels, a fourth reflection answer, optional context
  notes, Google prompt changes and broader affect terminology require separate product evidence
  or approval. They are not unfinished migration work.

## Deferred External Evidence

- Low-tier Android: existing three-run matrix when a distinct device is available.
- Moderated comprehension: six real participants using
  `docs/moderated-comprehension-validation.md`; synthetic review is not a substitute.
- Full human TalkBack J1-J9: previously waived; retain the distinction from bounded passed
  checkpoints and browser semantics. No new speech pass claimed by this maintenance work.
- Native macOS Safari: retry after Safari/SafariDriver changes; the recorded transport failure
  occurred before product rows.
- iOS simulator: existing acceptance/robustness when the runtime is available, particularly after
  adapter changes. Physical iPhone testing remains outside scope.
- Live regions containing controls and modal background exposure: native AT risks, not confirmed
  defects. Obtain direct evidence before altering announcements or adding inert behavior.

These prerequisites do not block verified product fixes or justify inventing new features.

## Implementation And Verification Rules

Smallest failing regression -> bounded fix -> focused checks -> frozen release candidate.
Use `docs/release-quality-gates.md` for executable gates; do not maintain a second command list.
Run suites sequentially when they share build/test artifacts. Require exact-revision CI/deploy/
public smoke and affected live journeys; push success or HTTP 200 alone is insufficient.
Keep the existing 150,000-byte initial gzip JS limit. Inspect actual module ownership, not just
a wrapper filename; static startup, total assets, offline precache and physical timing differ.

Preserve client-only storage, no telemetry/backend, selected-word-only AI handoff, informal
Romanian singular, bilingual copy, reversible selection and deterministic safety semantics.
Do not change scoring, guidance or language contracts during cleanup.

KISS/YAGNI: no router/state-library/repository rewrite without demonstrated need.
DRY/Rule of Three: share repeated behavior, not vaguely similar platform workflows.
SoC/POLA: storage, workflow, catalog and presentation retain clear ownership.
Fail Fast: validate records/provenance and reject forbidden startup imports.
Gall's Law: ship verified increments; stop when the bounded acceptance criteria pass.

A new versioned release is optional and requires synchronized release identity owners.
Do not move the existing v0.1.6 tag to newer maintenance commits.
